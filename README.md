## Authorship Attribution in Single and Cross-Genre Settings: An Approach Based on Genre Classification

## Abstract

This thesis is about authorship attribution (AA), the task that aims to identify the author of a text, given a model of authorial style based on texts of known authorship. The two main factors that characterize a text are its content and its style, and both can be used as a means of categorization. This thesis presents an approach to text categorization in terms of genre and author by focusing on a corpus of novels, plays and essays by six contemporary Dutch-language authors. It does so by using common stylometric features, viz. the most frequent tokens and character n-grams, respectively. Next, it discusses a set of small-scale but reasonable experiments in genre classification and authorship attribution, both within and across genres, to test the hypothesis that the more likely two genres are to be confused for one another, the worse attribution performance across these two genres will be. Various performance issues regarding the training set size and the significance of the methodology, style markers, and results are also addressed.


## Repository Overview

The "DepauwThesisCode" folder contains all relevant items, including a Jupyter Notebook with the source code used for the experiments reported on in the Master's Thesis. It also includes a folder containing some of the Figures (confusion matrices, graphs, etc.) used throughout the thesis to allow for better/easier viewing, making quick comparisons, etc. Due to copyright restrictions, the data/corpus used for the thesis will not be made publicly available alongside the code, but the code can be adapted/built upon to work with similar corpora to replicate the experiments.
